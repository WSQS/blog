## Introduction

### What Is This Book?

ref:《Learning Processing》

Goal for this book is simple: I want to take a look at phenomena that naturally occur in the physical world and figure out how to write code to simulate them.

If this book is anything, it’s an old-fashioned programming textbook, and particular focus on object-oriented programming.

## Randomness

### The Random Walker Class

object and class

In javascript, constructor function of a class is the member function `constructor()`.

In javascript, using `let` or `const` to declare variables.

There is `===` and `==` in javascript.

### A Normal Distribution of Random Numbers

normal distribution (sometimes called a Gaussian distribution, after mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss)

bell curve

`randomGaussian()`function takes care of the math and returns random numbers with a normal distribution
