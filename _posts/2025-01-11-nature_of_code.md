## Introduction

### What Is This Book?

ref:《Learning Processing》

Goal for this book is simple: I want to take a look at phenomena that naturally occur in the physical world and figure out how to write code to simulate them.

If this book is anything, it’s an old-fashioned programming textbook, and particular focus on object-oriented programming.
