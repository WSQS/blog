Context and Context size

Neural networks are the building blocks of AI

Potential in complex ai system.

## What do we do?

- Creation
- Analysis

## Analysis

LLM is good at Analysis.

We need more information.

- Classification
- Source Identification

We want AI:

- Analyze what we have
- Determine what else we need
- Collect what we need

Training on your codebase does not remove the need for including code in your context.

LLM are not reliable

Reproducibility, Unit test.

- Temperature parameter

## Creation

ref: [podcast](https://adspthepodcast.com/)

Implement `std::unique` in parallel

`thrust::unique`

// TODO: Parallel is hard for me.

takeaway:

- Using LLM for Brainstorming or Refinement
- Work step-by-step
- Guide the AI

We judge AI Unfairly.

- Success with AI models for software engineering requires skill.
