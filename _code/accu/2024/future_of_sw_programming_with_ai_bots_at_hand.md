Goal: Discuss the future of programming with AI bots

## Intro

LLM

Predicting the next token by previous tokens

Pros and Cons of LLMs

## In a Search of a Silver Bullet

ref: No Silver Bullet by Fred Brooks 1986

Essence and Accident

There is Silver Bullet in other domain

## Requirements

- Identifying Inconsistencies
- Verify Completeness

## Coding and Testing

- Calculating Distance
- Comparing to Zero
- Variadic pack short-circuit evaluation
- Explaining Code
- Fixing Code
  - Self Healing CI Automation

- Testing
- Bigger Code Challenges

## Is C++ Special

C++ Problem domains are usually harder, use ai in less-complicated problem.

Alternative: Assembly Python Rust

## Getting Prepared

- Daily Work
- Task Management
- Code Quality

ref: Coding on Copilot: 2003 Data Suggests Downward Pressure on Code Quality

ref: Fast and Slow Thinking

- Use AI models for tasks that makes you more productive
- Take into account the limitation and pitfalls of generated code

## Conclusions and recommendations

- Never rely on anything without reviewing it. Trust nothing.
- The skill of reading code becomes even more important than ever.
