Atomic: the tool of lock-free programming

Lock-free means "fast".

## Is lock-free faster?

- Algorithm rules supreme
- Wait free has nothing to do with time.
- Atomic operations do not guarantee good performance.

What is an atomic operation?

Atomic operation is an operation that is guaranteed to execute as a single transaction

ref: C++ Atomics in cppcon 2015

Type for atomic:Any trivially copyable type can be made atomic

## Operations

Operations: Assignment, special atomic operations, other operations depend on the type T.

`x *= 2;` will not compile

`x = x + 1;` and `x = x * 2;` is not atomic. It's atomic read followed by atomic write.

`std::atomic<T>` provides operator overloads only for atomic operations.

Increment and decrement for raw pointers.

`std::atomic<bool>` is valid, no special operations

`std::atomic<double>` is valid, no special operations

### Member functions

`load` `store`

`exchange` is like `std::swap`

`compare_exchange_strong` for conditional exchange

Compare and swap(CAS) is used in most lock free algorithms.

`fetch_add`... add and return old value.

`std::atomic` provides operator overloads only for atomic operations.

## Speed

Always measured performance

Comparing atomic operation with another thread-safe alternative is valid and useful.

ref: spinlock

`std::atomic` isn't always lock free.

`std::atomic::is_always_lock_free()` to check is the type lock free. It's runtime and platform dependentï¼Œ based on alignment and padding.

Two thread access 2 variable with in 64 bytes will wait as if it was the same variable.

Atomic operations do wait on each other, write do, read only can scale near perfectly.

Atomic operations have to wait for cache line access.

Avoid false sharing by aligning per-thread data to separate cache lines.

## Strong and Weak compare-and-swap

c++ provides two versions of CAS

`compare_exchange_strong` and `compare_exchange_weak`

problem: if weak CAS correctly returns x == old+x, why would it fail?

Lock is not a real mutex but some form of exclusive access implemented in hardware.

Read is faster than write.
