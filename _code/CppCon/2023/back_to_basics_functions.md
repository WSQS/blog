Functions in programing languages are used to express math and more exciting ideas.

Functions are a way to group related code.

- Some functions purely run a routine of code -- no return value.
- Some functions compute a new value from 0 or more inputs.
- Some functions mutate a given input and/or output.

std::optional means 0 or 1 value are returned.

- Separating functions into separate files
  - reuse your functions in other projects
  - hide your implementation details from users
  - protentially speed up compilation
  - utilize only the functionality you need by breaking up source in to modules of related functions.

objdump

static function to hide function from user.

using namespace to grout functions together.

C++20 include Modules.

- Virtual functionality
- Vtable

constexpr: compute at compile time.

pure function: same input same output.

std::span can both hold the pointer and the length.

function should only do one thing.
