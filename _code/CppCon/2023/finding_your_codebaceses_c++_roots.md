Taking genealogy and apply if for C++.

- Sometimes we don't have all the information.
- Solving mysteries given a known/semi-unknown marco histoey.
- Codebases are micro-histories much like family trees are to historical data.

- Naming: Duplicate names happens all the time.
- FAN Principle
  - Frindes
  - Associates
  - Neighbors
- what did they specialize in
  - workflow wise

  - style version
  - workplace
  - documentation guidlines
- where did they work in the code
  - primarily work
- why did they make their choices
  - work fast
  - clean up
  - architect solutionsion
