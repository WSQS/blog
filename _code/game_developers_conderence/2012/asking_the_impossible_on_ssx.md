- Show Some of last 20 years of Procedural tools in Film
- Talk about Applying Proven Solutions to New Problems
- Talk about how we did this on SSX(Snowboard Supercross)
- Difficulties were more Cultural than Technical

## Some History

- Human Animation R&D
- Morphogenesis
- Volume Tools
- A Garden of Eden
- Frag Tool
- Stadium Tool

Old Pipeline has a gap in tool developer and content developer.

## SSX

- Proof of Concept
- MountainMan

Quality of art is decided by the speed of iteration.

## Procedural Approach

- Start with the simplest modular
  - Path
  - Terrain
  - Instances
  - Mesh
  - Lights
  - Audio
  - Effects
- Get it working first, then improve it based on user changes.

First Workflow: 2D Manifolds

Search for a ideal track.

Data is form nasa.

- First Workflow: Hand-waving part of the explanation, add attributes to the curve.
- Second Workflow
  - The Cavalry
  - 3D Voxel Sets: Easy for operation add subtract
  - Tools evolve with Art
  - Expectation management
  - Problem:
    - Mesh Detail keep
    - UV map
- Third Workflow
  - Hierarchical Volumes
  - Profile Editing
  - A New Surfacer is crucial now
  - ref: High Quality, Curvature Dependent Triangulation of Implicit Surfaces
  - Problem:
    - Hard to evaluate game play
- Fourth Workflow
  - Point Clouds
- Final Workflow
  - Path Generation
  - Path Attributes
  - Profile Editing
  - Profile Sweeping
  - Subtracting Tunnels
  - Skirt Generation
  - Surfacing
  - Detail Preservation
  - Instance Placement
  - Surface Alteration
